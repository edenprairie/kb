**Phone Interview Expectations &amp; Tips:**

- Be prepared to answer both behavioral as well as technical questions.  For guidance on answering behavioral questions, Google the &quot;STAR Method.&quot;

-
  - Situation:  Describe the situation that you were in or the task you needed to accomplish.
  - Task:  Describe the goal you were working toward.
  - Action:  Describe the actions you took to address the situation.
  - Result:  Describe the outcome of your actions.

- Be sure to think of at least 3 – 5 thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer.  It is always ideal to have a few extra questions prepared, in the event that a few of your questions are already discussed throughout the interview/conversation.

-
  - Questions should be focused on the  **position and company**.  Discussing salary, benefits, etc. should wait until the offer stage.
  - Feel free to write the questions down and refer to them at the end of the interview.
  - _We can review the questions you&#39;ve prepared via phone prior to your interview._

- Review your resume before the interview and have it in front of you during the interview in case you need to reference it.
- Be positive and enthusiastic in your responses.  Do not be afraid to let your personality show!  Smile! ?
- Follow the interviewer&#39;s lead throughout and let him her guide the conversation and questions.
- Defer any conversations about compensation back to me.  I will handle this and negotiate on your behalf.
- Focus on answering the question asked and try to be direct and concise.  If you feel like you may not have fully answered the question, but want to avoid rambling as well, a good way to address the situation is just to ask – &quot;did that answer your question, or would you like for me to provide additional details?&quot;
- Prepare specific examples of previous experience that relates directly to this position.
- Research the company in depth, understanding their product or service, locations, competitors, time in business and ownership/senior management
